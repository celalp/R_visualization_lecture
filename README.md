# R visualization lecture

To prepare for the CCM Bioinformatics tips and tricks data visualization lecture:

+ Install the latest version of R from CRAN [](https://cran.r-project.org/)
+ Have the RStudio software pre-installed from [](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download)
+ Install packages ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork, pheatmap and viridis (optional) using the command `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "patchwork", "pheatmap", "dplyr", "pheatmap"))`
+ If you prefer you can review the cheat-sheets in this repository. 

The code that is generated during the lecture will appear here after the talk.
